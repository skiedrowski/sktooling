# Authentication JAX-RS 2.x+
This package includes server-side and client-side code for HTTP-Basic authentication using JAX-RS 2.x filters.

## Customization Points
* `AuthenticationProvider`: authentication mechanism (Basic, Digest, ...) 
  * There is one implementation `HTTPBasicAuthenticationProvider` 
* `AuthenticationExceptionMapper`: Realm Name (for displaying to the user) should be provided in a `config.properties` 
	file (working dir or specified via SystemProperty) with key `www_authenticate_realm_name`. See `cdi-properties` project for details.

## Server
The server side part is more or less described on http://bitsuppliers.com/securing-rest-resources-with-java-ee-7-and-jax-rs-2-0/.

Default: all JAX-RS Methods need authentication.
If a method may be called without authentication, you may annotate it with `@AuthenticationNotRequired`.

`AuthenticationFilter` is a JAX-RS `ContainerRequestFilter` which can be applied to resources dynamically using `AuthenticationFeature` (a JAX-RS `DynamicFeature`).
`AuthenticationFeature` registers `AuthenticationFilter` for all contexts (JAX-RS methods) which are _not_ annotated with `@AuthorizationNotRequired`.

`AuthenticationFilter` uses `AuthenticationProvider` to authenticate the client.
`HTTPBasicAuthenticationProvider` implements HTTP Basic authentication. If authentication fails, an `AuthenticationException` is thrown. This exception is picked up by `AuthenticationExceptionMapper` which returns a HTTP response with status code 401 - Unauthorized. It also adds the `WWW-Authenticate` to the response which could be picked up by a client to display a user/password input dialog.

## Client
The client side part is inspired by http://www.adam-bien.com/roller/abien/entry/client_side_http_basic_access.

`Authenticator` is a JAX-RS `ClientRequestFilter` which may be used to provide credentials to the server.

## Limitations
* Basic Authentication does not provide encryption, so you need to encrypt the data (i.e. using HTTPS)
* The challenge-response mechanism using `WWW-Authenticate` is untested.
